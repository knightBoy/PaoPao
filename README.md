## Project Introduction

This is a location-based chat dating software developed by Java and Android. I created it for learning Java and Android in October 2015.

In this app, you can chat with others(The premise is that you have an openfire server), and you can browse for news posted by your friends, aquire messages from people you don't know ever.

##  Permission Statement

I have stopped developing, so you can do anything with it.
